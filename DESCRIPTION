Description: Tools for assessing exotic species' contributions to
        landscape homogeneity using average pairwise Jaccard similarity
        and an analytical approximation derived in Harris et al. (2011,
        "Occupancy is nine-tenths of the law," The American
        Naturalist). Also includes a randomization method for assessing
        sources of model error.
